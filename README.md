## Description 

In this groundbreaking zombie horde game, players face off against zombie armies in a post-apocalyptic world, with the novel incorporation of blockchain technology to award NFTs for gameplay achievements. These NFT rewards, ranging from digital art to rare in-game items, offer real-world value, collectibility, and unique customization options, providing a compelling financial and strategic incentive. This approach not only enhances engagement and investment in the game but also fosters a vibrant community of gamers and collectors, motivated by the dual thrill of gameplay and the opportunity to earn valuable digital assets.
## How the game starts

After clicking on start, the user has to connect its metamask wallet in order to proceed. This is a required step as the game is based on collecting the token and a wallet is requred in order to do so.

This is how the asset map looks like:

## Game Behaviour
Player: The player starts of with a gun in it's hand, it has all the basic functionalites as that of a regular player in a regular game like walking, running, crouching, jumping.

The player's objective is to kill the zombies that will be spawned and will be following the player in order to kill them.

Player shooting: Using Cinemachine, it was very helpful to create functionalities like aiming and zooming using the gun with the help of animations, it gives more realistic view.

The player gun shoots bullets with a muzzle fire and added some bullet sounds just to make the game more realistic.

This how it looks with the player having the gun and with the zombies.
## Zombie Behaviour
AI Navmesh made it easier for defining the zombie behaviour. I took some random positions in the map and spawned these zombies at those positions. The player's position is fixed for them as the follow position, so wherever they are spawned in the map, they will be following the player wherever it is moving.

The player, as soon as it kills the horde, the token will be transferred in the player's wallet.

Since I built this in a 1 day hackathon,with my fellow team members, the game does not have much functionality apart from the ones mentioned, but there will be more stuff to add in the game which will surely be an attention grabber!
